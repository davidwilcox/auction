      Welcome to the SVUUS Auction Website! Thank you for participating. This year the auction will be held online, but will still be the awesome party we all love!
      </p>
      <p>
To get started on the site, click the “Register” button above to create an account. Have a photo of yourself and/or your family ready to upload. This is useful so that if you donate an item, others can see who you are and who donated it. Try to use a closeup photo of faces.

Second, buy tickets

Note #1: Typically adults and high school students attend the main auction event, but this year it’s open to all ages.  Each purchased auction ticket will come with a bidding number to use during the live auction, and an auction party bag.  The party bag will be available for pickup before the auction and includes auction details and fun party items.

The children auction is typically attended by those in junior high and elementary school, though younger children are also welcome with an adult to help. Children will be given fake virtual money to use for bidding in the children's auction and a fun party bag.

Note #2: The credit card you use to buy your tickets will be used to pay your final invoice after the auction.
