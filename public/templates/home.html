  <p>
    Welcome to the SVUUS Auction Website!  Thank you for participating.  It should be a great party!
  </p>
  <p>
    To get started on the site, click the “Register” button above to create an account.  Have a photo of yourself and/or your family ready to upload.  This is useful so that if you donate an item, others can see who you are and who donated it. Try to use a closeup photo of faces.
  </p>
  <p>
    Second, buy tickets for you and your family members who are attending.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note #1:  There are activities for kids ages 5 and up—but there is nothing for kids age four and below, so we recommend you keep them with a babysitter that night.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note #2:  The credit card you use to buy your tickets will be used to pay your final invoice after the auction.
  </p>
  <p>

    Third, donate items to auction.  If you need suggestions, you can click below.

    <div>
      <md-button ng-click="showIdeas($event)" class='md-primary md-raised'>Donation Ideas</md-button>
    </div>

  <p>
    If you have not been to one of our auctions before, there’s a “Donation Ideas” button on the donation page that’ll get you started.
  </p>
  <p>

    The Auction will start promptly at 6:00pm on Saturday, November 12th.  There are no physical tickets.  Just show up and we’ll give you your bid card.
