    Thanks for your generosity and for the donation. Make sure to bring your item to South Valley before noon on Saturday the 12th in order for us to categorize it for the auction on time. A great day would be Sunday November 6, right after service, or during office hours M W Th 1:30-5:30, Tu F 1:30-4:30 or when the decorating crew is in the building Friday or Saturday.
    Thanks again!
